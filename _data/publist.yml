- title: "Robust self-testing of multiparticle entanglement"
  image: selftesting1.pdf
  description: Here, we demonstrate the first robust self-testing for multi-particle quantum entanglement. We prepare two examples of four-photon graph states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with a fidelity of 0.957(2) and the linear cluster states with a fidelity of 0.945(2). Based on the observed input-output statistics, we certify the genuine four-photon entanglement and further estimate their qualities with respect to realistic noise in a device-independent manner.

- title: "Exploiting anticommutation in Hamiltonian simulation"
  image: Anti.png
  description: Here, we theoretically explore the role of anti-commutative relation in Hamiltonian simulation. We find that, contrary to our intuition, anticommutative relations could also reduce the hardness of Hamiltonian simulation.  Specifically, Hamiltonians with mutually anti-commutative terms are easy to simulate, as what happens with ones consisting of mutually commutative terms.  Such a property is further utilized to reduce the algorithmic error or the gate complexity in the truncated Taylor series quantum algorithm for general problems.  Moreover, we propose two modified linear combinations of unitaries methods tailored for Hamiltonians with different degrees of anti-commutation. We numerically verify that the proposed methods exploiting anti-commutative relations could significantly improve the simulation accuracy of electronic Hamiltonians.

  description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.

- title: "Entanglement structure: Entanglement partitioning in multipartite systems and its experimental detection using optimizable witnesses"
  image: dummy.png
  description: Here, we propose two complementary families of witnesses for the identification of such structures. They are based, respectively, on the detection of entanglement intactness and entanglement depth, each applicable to an arbitrary number of subsystems and whose evaluation requires only the implementation of solely two local measurements. Our method is also robust against noises and other imperfections, as reflected by our experimental implementation of these tools to verify the entanglement structure of five different eight-photon entangled states. In particular, we demonstrate how their entanglement structure can be precisely and systematically inferred from the experimental measurement of these witnesses. In achieving this goal, we also illustrate how the same set of data can be classically postprocessed to learn the most about the measured system.

- title: "One-shot coherence dilution"
  image: dilution.png
  description: This Letter establishes the one-shot theory of coherence dilution, which involves converting maximally coherent states into an arbitrary quantum state using maximally incoherent operations, dephasing-covariant incoherent operations, incoherent operations, or strictly incoherent operations. We introduce several coherence monotones with concrete operational interpretations that estimate the one-shot coherence cost—the minimum amount of maximally coherent states needed for faithful coherence dilution. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic coherence dilution results with maximally incoherent operations, incoherent operations, and strictly incoherent operations as special cases. Our result can be applied in the analyses of quantum information processing tasks that exploit coherence as resources, such as quantum key distribution and random number generation.
